## Project Description
The project focuses on implementing classic computer vision algorithms to track a colored ball in a video. 

By implementing classic computer vision algorithms for video object tracking, the project aims to provide a foundation for understanding 
and experimenting with fundamental concepts in computer vision. It serves as a starting point for more advanced tracking techniques and can 
be extended to track other objects or incorporate additional features, such as real-time tracking or multi-object tracking.
